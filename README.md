  <h1> Third Task of Level 1</h1>
    
  <h2>Projec Review: </h2>
In this project, I analyzed a restaurant dataset to identify the following two key questions:

1. To create the chisxtogram or xbar chart to visualize the distribution of price range among the restaurants.<br> 
2. To calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price range category.

<h1>Tools & Technologies:</h1>

To achieve this, I used the following tools and technologies:

1. Python: Programming language
2. NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
3. Pandas: For data analysis, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
4. Matplotlib: For data visualization, including plots, charts, and graphs.
5. Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, building on Matplotlib.
6. Jupyter Notebook(IDEs): As the primary environment for data processing and analysis.<br><br>
These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.</p>

<h1>Results:</h1>
<p> At first, I tried to find out the price range category and arranged them in ascending order: <br>
The price range are:<br>
1    4438<br>
2    3113<br>
3    1405<br>
4     586
<br><br>
And then I plotted the bar chart with different colors of the above price range category. Here is the link to view the chart. :<br>![download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6539451-408b-4587-90d0-398fab7d1b4a)
  And then i found out the Price range distribution and I got the required reults:<br><br>
  Price Range Distribution:<br>
  1. Price Range 1: 46.51% of restaurants<br>
  2. Price Range 2: 32.62% of restaurants<br>
  3. rice Range 3: 14.72% of restaurants<br>
  4. Price Range 4: 6.14% of restaurants<br>
Thus, I got the required keys of the given two questions of the task3:<br><br> 
A huge thanks to Conifyz Technologies for this amazing learning opportunity! Every step in this journey is helping me grow, and I'm excited for what's next.<br><br>
