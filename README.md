  <h1> Task 3_L#1: PRICE RANGE DISTRIBUTION</h1>
    
  <h2>Projec Review: </h2>
In this project, I analyzed a restaurant dataset to identify the following two key questions:

1. To create the a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of price range among the restaurants.<br> 
2. To calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price range category.

<h1>Tools & Technologies:</h1>

To achieve this, I used the following tools and technologies:

1. Python: Programming language
2. NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
3. Pandas: For data analysis, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
4. Matplotlib: For data visualization, including plots, charts, and graphs.
5. Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, building on Matplotlib.
6. Jupyter Notebook(IDEs): As the primary environment for data processing and analysis.<br><br>
These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.</p>

<h1>Results:</h1>
<p> At first, I tried to find out the price range category and arranged them in ascending order: <br>
  <p>The price range are:</p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>4438</td></tr>
       <tr><td>2</td><td>3113</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>1405</td></tr>
         <tr><td>4</td><td>586</td></tr>  
    </tbody>
  </table>
<br>
And then I plotted the bar chart with different colors of the above price range category. Here is the link to view the chart. :<br><br>![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0086bb7a-cabc-4158-962d-f9efb0cc9208)

  And then I found out the price range distribution> Here is the required reults:<br><br>
  Price Range Distribution:<br>
  <table>
    <tbody> <tr><td></td><td></td></tr>
      <tr><td>1</td><td>Price Range 1: 46.51% of restaurants</td></tr>
       <tr><td>2</td><td>Price Range 2: 32.62% of restaurants </tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>Price Range 3: 14.72% of restaurants</td></td></tr>
         <tr><td>4</td><td>Price Range 4: 6.14% of restaurants </td></tr> 
    </tbody>
  </table>
<br<<br>
Thus, I got the required keys of the given two questions of the task3:<br><br>
